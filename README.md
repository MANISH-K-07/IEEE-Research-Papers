### 1. Charity with Clarity : Crowdfunding using Smart contracts
I have been working on a Research group project on the topic of CROWDFUNDING via Smart Contracts - An Implementation of Blockchain Technology. 
Recently finished the code base and assembled my work. This paper related to Crypto Crowdfunding using a custom developed Smart Contract aided by Blockchain technology is finally getting published at IEEE. Blockchain is an emerging hot pot in the industry and learning this technology was loads of fun.
Applying it to code a Smart Contract that resolves the problem of transparency and trust issues with third party organisations like NGOs is the basic idea behind this innovative project.
